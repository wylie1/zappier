An about me file

Dwells in a small city, enjoys its culture. Gardens, has chickens.  Has had a soft tech career; would like to grow. 

I build process and a communicate to solve problems. 

IVe used Zapier in the past, probably applied for a support job. Might do again. 

For this role, I'd have done support for more or less 12 years in progressively growing role.  Ive been in 3 startsups, and Ive grown with each of them.
